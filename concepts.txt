##----------------Linear Regression Loss-------------------
Function:
*** Loss=MSE ===> 1​∑(y−y^​)2 ***

1.What term is added?
-Only the prediction error is minimized

2.What does it encourage or discourage?
-encourages the model to fit the training data
-doesnot encourage large cooefficients

3.how it affect on complexity and generalization?
-model can assign large weights to features
-sensitive to noise

##-----------------Ridge Regression Loss--------------------
Function:
** Loss= MSE+λ∑w2 **

1.What term is added?
-L2 penalty (sum of squared coefficients)

2.What does it encourage or discourage?
-discourages large coefficient values
-does not force to zero

3.Effect on complexity and generalization
-Controls model complexity by shrinking weights
-reduces variance

##------------------Lasso Regression Loss-----------------------
Function:
** Loss=MSE+λ∑∣w∣ **

1.What term is added?
-L1 penalty (sum of absolute values of coefficients)

2.What does it encourage or discourage?
-encourages the model to shrink the cooefficients to zero.

3.Effect on complexity and generalization
-performs automatic feature selection
-reduces model complexity
-removes irrelevant or redundant features
