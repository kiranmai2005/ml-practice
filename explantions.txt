** Linear Regression ** 
It derives the relationship between independent varibles and dependent varibles or in other words it finds out
the cooefficients of the features.

** Formulae:**
y=mx+c 
m--- slope
x-- data point
c-bias/intercept


1------------Why squared error is used?-----------------
A. The metric mean squared error is used to understand how our model is performing on the data points like whether it is 
overfitting or underfitting.

2-------------What minimizing the loss actually means----------------
A. minimizing the loss actually means reducing the errors that the model is making by adjusting the parameters/
weights of the model. by reducing the loss our model actually performs well.

3----------------how the model parameters influence the loss------------------
--If weights are poorly chosen -> predictions are far from true values -> large errors
--Squaring these errors -> very high loss
--Adjusting weights moves the line/curve
--If the curve moves closer to data points -> errors decrease
Lower errors -> lower loss

4-------------------Why does training error always decrease with higher polynomial degree?----------
A. as the degree increases gradually we can observe that the error reduces bcz the model starts fitting the data perfectly. it smoothens the curve.
the model fixes the labels for the datapoints i.e it memorizes the answers

5------------------Why does test error behave differently-------------------
A. as the test data is unseen for the model it behaves differently bcz the model has learnt perfectly the X_train and y_train and 
cant predict on unknown point as the model complexity is higher now

6---------------At what point does the model start overfitting, and how can you tell?--------------
A. as the degree of the polynomial features kept increasing the squared error was reducing indicating the overfitting of the points and labels
and the error reduces to 0 gradually which means overfitting
from the plot we can also observe that for higher degrees the line was following the sine curve perfectly.
by these factors we can tell the model is overfitting.

7----------------If you had to choose one polynomial degree, which would it be and why?-------------
A. the one polynomial degree which i might choose is 2 or 3 where the model doesnt tend to overfit or underfit.
it learns the patterns and finds the relationships rather than memorizing at that degree of polynomial.
