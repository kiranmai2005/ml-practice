1----------------Why does regularization improve test performance?----------------------
A.regularization prevents the model from fitting the noise and improve generalization of the model.
--like in the ridge it pulls/shrinks the value closer to 0 

2----------------Why does Ridge keep all features but shrink them?-------------------------
Ridge uses a L2 penalty to the coefficients which shrinks them towards to zero but doesnot set them exactly to zero.
this way it helps the model by reducing the focus on less important features making it to less prone to overfitting.

3--------------Why does Lasso remove features entirely?----------------------
Lasso uses L1 penalty which encourages the model to shrink the coefficients to zero.by eliminating the less important
features it improves the model's interpretability and prevents overfitting.

4---------------Why does Elastic Net behave differently from both?---------------
elastic net behave differently from both lasso and ridge because it combines the strength of the models.
lasso reduces coefficients to zero which can be beneficial for feature selection.
ridge shrinks coefficients to closer to zero but doesnot perform feature selection.

5---------------Which model performed best on your dataset and why?----------------
ridge regression performed best on diabetes dataset because it achieved lower test error with controlled model complexity
and kept all the features.
